# 💬 Chatbot Animation Sample

This project is a **simple example** of an animated chatbot built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **no external dependencies**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The widget is designed to **encourage users to click** on the chatbot by triggering a **subtle animation a few seconds after page load**. It aims to draw attention in a smooth, non-intrusive way.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Clean and modern UI
- ✨ Subtle animation triggered after a short delay
- 💬 Fully functional chatbot with automatic simulated replies
- 🔊 Notification sound when sending messages
- 🚫 No external libraries or frameworks required

## 🧪 Demo

When the page loads, the chatbot widget stays minimized. After a few seconds, a subtle animation grabs the user’s attention. Upon clicking, the chatbot opens and allows the user to type messages. The bot automatically sends predefined replies.
